Log into your GitHub account and then click on "Use this template" on the upper-right side of this screen.

Next, modify the project_2_submission.txt file to input your Project 2 results.

To get full credit, you will need to upload your relevant files here, as well as onto Learning Suite when you are satisfied with your score here.
Click on the IFC_Files folder and then upload all of your IFC files for this project.
Similarly, click on the CSV_Files folder and then upload all of your CSV files for this project.
Finally, upload your Geometry_Operations.py, Structure_Operations.py, and Method_of_Joints.py files.
Be sure to test on your own machine prior to uploading lest you end up in an infinite loop.

To see your results, click on the actions tab, as before. Red X's mean that some of your tests do not pass. If you click on the "Test Input Project 2 Code" tab of the build action, you will see your score based on input.
